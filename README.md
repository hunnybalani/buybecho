## About this Project

Due to lack of communication between students of a university, many individual resources
are not efficiently shared. For example books, notes, coolers, mattresses or other
necessary items remain unused when it could have been given to others who needed
them. Aim of this project is to build a platform where different students from the same
university can contact each other for sharing the products that they no longer need.The
portal serves as a bridge to connect the buyer and seller among the student community.
